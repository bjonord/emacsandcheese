;;; Very simple refactoring code for Ruby-mode

;;; These are some very simple minded Ruby refactoring functions.
;;; They perform almost no syntax analsys (and therefore depend on the
;;; user doing the right thing), but are quite useful nevertheless.
;;;
;;; The extraction style refactorings work by marking the code to be
;;; extracted into a method, constant, or temp variable. Then the user
;;; runs the desired extraction method (e.g. rrf-extract-constant).
;;; Then the user moves the cursor to the location the extracted code
;;; will be inserted and runs the generic insert function
;;; (rrf-insert-extraction, generally bound to "C-Cay").
